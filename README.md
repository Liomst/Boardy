# Boardy

Boardy is a small Vue.js project that provides a simple and intuitive task board to help you organize your tasks efficiently. You can create to-dos, drag and drop them between different columns, view details, and edit them. Each task can have a title, description, and due date, so you always know what needs to be done and by when.
